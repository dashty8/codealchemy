# CodeAlchemy

**CodeAlchemy** transforms natural language into code through a simple, intuitive interface in VS Code. Unlike other complex AI coding tools, CodeAlchemy focuses on simplicity and visual feedback.

## ‚ú® Extreme Simplicity by Design

In a world of bloated, complicated tools, CodeAlchemy takes a different approach:

- **Single-purpose focus**: Generate, update, or refactor code with natural language
- **Minimal UI**: Just type what you want, no complex configurations
- **Visual feedback**: See your code being written character-by-character
- **Focused functionality**: Does one thing extremely well
